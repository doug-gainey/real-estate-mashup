# Real Estate Mashup
This is a tool I wrote years ago to aggregate foreclosure listings in my home state.  I used it to target foreclosures for my rental business.  I no longer use it, but it was an invaluable tool for targeting investment properties at the time.  The sites it scrapes have probably changed, so it would likely take some work to get it going again.
